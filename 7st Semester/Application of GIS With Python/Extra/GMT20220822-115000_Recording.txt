03:23:59	Madan Kumar Khadka:	yes Prof
03:24:08	Mubarak Maseeh Michael:	yes professor
03:24:37	Nasir Farid:	According to the program Lecture 4: Intelligent Remote Sensing
Program schedule changed?
03:25:00	Wei Min-2:	Yes
03:25:04	8408629117 :	screen not shared
03:25:15	Wei Min-2:	It will be tomorrow
03:25:49	TA-Wenjing Zhang:	Yes, the lecture 4 and lecture 6 have been exchanged.
03:26:22	Alexander Holsteinson:	WeChat still doesn't allow joining
03:26:22	TA-Wenjing Zhang:	The title is :Night-time Light Remote Sensing
03:28:13	Tirtha Raj Basnet:	https://chat.whatsapp.com/F3Dwb6I3MORK0A6RnatkZx
03:28:13	Madan Kumar Khadka:	Yunnan is comparatively dark
03:28:33	Kanwal Javid:	temporal information of this image is not mentioned
03:29:37	syeda zara:	the lecture 6 is given on place of lecture 4. that's all. fellow students. lets focus on lecture.
03:30:23	Rizwan Khalid:	why Japan is the brightest in the satellite imagery?
03:31:36	Usman Mehmood:	from which satellite we get light data of 1993?
03:32:06	Ayesha Riaz:	which satellite is best to get light data for south Asian region?
03:33:16	Kavach Mishra:	What is the spatial resolution of nightlight time data? What is its revisit time?
03:33:22	Ceren Özcan Tatar:	usher hardcore girdi
03:33:54	Kanwal Javid:	is night time data tell use actual population density of any region?
03:34:22	Johanes Muhimbula:	What are the software that are most popular in the acquisition of the NL images
03:34:24	ife oyekanmi:	which satellite is best to get light data for  African region?
03:35:10	Rizwan Khalid:	Through which satellite these images are obtained?
03:35:52	Kanwal Javid:	Night time data give data in which unit?
03:36:15	Kanwal Javid:	it's pixel base?
03:36:48	hedayatullah:	we can Dedicate landcover area  in the night time image
03:36:54	Diwyacitta Dirda Gupita:	Satellite imageries are pixel-based
03:37:10	Yetunde Rotimi:	DMSP Satellite
03:37:15	Kanwal Javid:	if it's pixel base one pixel is equal to?
03:37:20	Kavach Mishra:	how to download Luojia-1 data? is it freely available for academic research?
03:37:52	ife oyekanmi:	Are imageries free?
03:38:04	Sabreena Ashraf:	What is the main philosophy behind the NLRS? How do we get this data? What all information could be acquired from it?
03:38:53	Kanwal Javid:	1 meter pixel contain how much lights or it's area based?
03:39:01	Diwyacitta Dirda Gupita:	depends on the provider, I guess. If it's only for visual presentation purposes, then maybe they're in DN units. If you want to do analyses, there must be some ways to transform those DNs to indices with certain units
03:39:10	waqar ahmed:	What analysis do we get from this night time remote sensing ?
03:40:00	Fredrik Angelo Francisco:	Are there any immediate obstacles or problems that can be encountered (and expected) when trying to handle data from NLRS?
03:40:27	Seid Ali Shifaw:	what is the role of this NLRS for environmental scientists ?
03:42:16	Aprilia Nidia Rinasti:	Hi, TA. Please erase the annotations from the shared screen.
03:42:56	Schneider Djossou:	How can we apply NLRS in road and bridge engineering?
03:43:04	Haldelio Hanif:	yes.. we don't need the annotation/ sub titles of this webinar. it so annoying
03:47:33	Mohamed Ashraf Maklad:	how could we recognize other types of lights, is there any criteria ?
03:52:34	Kanwal Javid:	Global GDP grid data source?
03:53:25	Hafsa Aeman:	Q1). High-Intensity information acquisition from NLRS leads to what information (like Number of lights or could be a single source light flux; like the measure of brightness) and Can it be interpreted related to urban density if yes then How.. Because a single object may contain a multiple light time information. Thank you
03:55:15	202208:	in stockholm, sweden shops get close early wheas in Karachi Pakistan, these remain open till late night.
03:55:35	Kanwal Javid:	more pixelate and destroy actual urban expansion view so for that coarse resolution is best
03:57:40	202208:	weather diff. between Asia and Europe can allo affect night time activity.
03:58:09	Kanwal Javid:	so Night time data is best for analyze the urban population not for rural population so what kind of satellite use for rural population?
04:00:37	Kanwal Javid:	is NL data informative for computing LST or atmospheric temperature as well?
04:10:36	SYED RAFI AHMED:	how can we get NL data
04:11:06	Waqar Fatima:	Question : Can we detect flood using Night light data?
04:11:41	SYED RAFI AHMED:	depending upon the water quality
04:12:00	Hassan HANNI:	what as the apport of land use and land cover for agriculture urban and peri urban for food security?
04:12:38	SYED RAFI AHMED:	fresh and pure water will absorb the whole light and water with impurities can help to detect the flood
04:13:09	SYED RAFI AHMED:	but it will not give exact information of flood
04:13:13	Abba Aliyu Kasim:	What are free sources of Night time light images?
04:13:17	SYED RAFI AHMED:	microwave data
04:13:26	SYED RAFI AHMED:	for flood
04:13:51	Hassan HANNI:	isn'ight light can do analysis for ka d useand land cover areas?
04:14:10	waqar ahmed:	How can the intensities be distinguished in the satellite imageries as In the night time we get the reflectance of the energy emitted by the earth as well as the intensities from the light pollution ?
04:14:45	Kanwal Javid:	night time data base on light street light etc it's gave reflectance related to light features....
04:15:12	Johanes Muhimbula:	How are we going to make the analysis of culture and how do we measure the culture of a place using the Night time light?
04:15:57	waqar ahmed:	this question is being answered by the professor and he is right now elaborating it as well
04:16:23	Johanes Muhimbula:	What are the models popular for using the night light images? and apart from Sentinel images what are other free images
04:17:21	waqar ahmed:	Landsat, aqua modis and terra modis,
04:18:00	Abdelaziz Merghadi:	Is it possible to get the link for the recorded session later?
04:18:05	Rizwan Khalid:	Landsat does not provide night light images
04:21:03	syeda zara:	what is time interval between taking pictures in these sattelites?
04:23:34	waqar ahmed:	time interval is also known as Temporal resolution, so it is different for different satellites depending upon the ordbit in which they are orbiting the earthLandsat has a temporal resolution of 16 days
04:24:38	Mohamed Ashraf Maklad:	please we need the ppt to benefit from these usefull informations
04:24:40	Abdelhamid Elnaggar:	why China doesn't provide free access to its remote sensing data like the USA?
04:25:12	Fahim Raza -Pakistan:	okay sir
